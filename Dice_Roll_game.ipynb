        "# **Project Overview:**\n",
        "In this project, you have to create a Dice Roll game in which two players will roll the dice one after another for 10 rounds. In each round, if the number on dice face for player 1 is greater than that for player 2, player 1 scores a point else player 2 will score a point. After 10 rounds, the player having the highest score is declared as the winner.\n",
